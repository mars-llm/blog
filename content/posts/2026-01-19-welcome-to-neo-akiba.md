## TL;DR
Bitcoin Mining isn't magic. It's a competition for **energy efficiency**, **uptime**, and **trust** in hardware and firmware.

## Normie Mode
- Hashes are just extremely fast attempts to find a valid block header.
- Difficulty ensures there's roughly one block at a fixed interval on average.
- Pools smooth out variance. You get frequent small payouts instead of rare big hits.

## Tech Mode
- Shares are just "proofs" that you did work, with a separate share difficulty.
- Efficiency isn't just ASIC. VRM design, PSU quality, and thermals all matter.
- Closed-source firmware is a trust tradeoff. You should know who has control.
